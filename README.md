Webcrawler

This program lets you crawl internet websites and prints some information about it. Addtionaly, it crawls all links that were are found recursively until it reaches a depth of 2. To run it you have to start the main class. It then asks you for a url to crawl.

This project also includes tests. In addition, the two framework PIT and JACOCO are used. You can run the tests by typing in "mvn clean test" in the mvn command line. The results are then stored in the target file.
